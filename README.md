## 1. Executive Summary

This document presents the development journey of **Study Resource Organizer (StudyPro)**, a modern, responsive web application built during the Hack Culprit Virtual Internship.

## 2. Problem Statement

Students preparing for competitive or academic exams often face difficulties managing their study materials, exam schedules, and important resources. There is a lack of lightweight, user-friendly platforms tailored specifically for study planning. This project bridges that gap by offering a centralized dashboard where students can manage resources, track upcoming exams, and bookmark essential links.
